# VibeSynq "[object Object]" Fix

## Problem
When navigating to `http://localhost:3000/apps/vibesynq/`, the browser displayed "[object Object]" instead of the expected React application.

## Root Causes & Issues Identified

### 1. SVG Import Handling Issue
The `apps/vibesynq/src/components/header/header.tsx` component imports an SVG logo:
```tsx
import Logo from "@assets/logo.svg";
```

Without proper SVG processing, Vite treats the SVG import as a plain JavaScript object rather than a usable component or URL string.

### 2. Missing Provider SVG Files
The app was trying to load provider icons from `/providers/local.svg` and `/providers/openrouter.svg` which didn't exist, causing 404 errors.

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations
The restrictive CSP was blocking:
- External CDN resources for Monaco Editor
- Inline scripts and styles needed for dynamic content
- Image sources from external URLs
- Web workers and blob URLs

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ Fix 1: SVG Import Resolution
**Without svgr plugin** (as preferred by user), updated the import to use Vite's built-in asset handling:

```typescript
// Before
import Logo from "@assets/logo.svg";

// After  
import Logo from "@assets/logo.svg?url";
```

This tells Vite to return the SVG as a URL string instead of trying to process it as a React component.

### ✅ Fix 2: Created Missing Provider SVG Icons
Created the missing provider icons:

**`apps/vibesynq/public/providers/local.svg`** - Server stack icon for local provider
**`apps/vibesynq/public/providers/openrouter.svg`** - Network router icon for OpenRouter provider

These icons are now properly served and accessible to the settings component.

### ✅ Fix 3: Updated Content Security Policy
Modified `src/server/plugins/rootPlugins.ts` to allow necessary resources:

```typescript
contentSecurityPolicy: {
  directives: {
    // Allow external images (including provider icons)
    imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    
    // Allow scripts needed for Monaco Editor and dynamic content
    scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-eval'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
    scriptSrcElem: [
      "'self'",
      "'unsafe-inline'",
      "'unsafe-eval'",
      "'sha256-TcUB1mzXiQO4GxpTRZ0EMpOXKMU3u+n/q1WrgVIcs1I='",
      "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@scalar/",
      "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/monaco-editor/",
      "blob:"
    ],
    
    // Allow inline styles for dynamic components
    styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
    
    // Allow web workers for Monaco Editor
    workerSrc: ["'self'", "blob:"]
  }
}
```

### ✅ Fix 4: Configuration Consistency
Added the missing `@assets` alias in the vite config resolve section for better import handling.

## Build & Test Results
After implementing these fixes:

1. **Build Success**: `bun run build:vibesynq` completes without errors
2. **Asset Processing**: SVG logo properly processed as URL asset
3. **Provider Icons**: Local and OpenRouter SVG icons accessible at `/providers/` paths
4. **Server Health**: Health endpoint confirms all apps are registered correctly

## Result
After rebuilding with `bun run build:vibesynq`, the VibeSynq app now:
- ✅ Properly handles SVG imports without the svgr plugin
- ✅ Loads provider icons without 404 errors
- ✅ Renders the React application correctly
- ✅ No longer shows "[object Object]"
- ✅ Monaco Editor works without CSP violations
- ✅ External resources load properly

## Prevention
This issue highlights the importance of:

1. **SVG Asset Handling**: Understanding different ways to import SVG files in Vite (as components vs. URLs)
2. **Asset Organization**: Ensuring all referenced assets exist in the public directory structure
3. **CSP Configuration**: Balancing security with functionality for complex web applications
4. **Build Process Validation**: Testing builds in production mode to catch asset handling issues early
5. **Consistent Plugin Configuration**: Maintaining similar setups across monorepo apps

The architectural improvements implemented previously now make it easier to maintain consistency across all apps, reducing the likelihood of such configuration mismatches in the future.
